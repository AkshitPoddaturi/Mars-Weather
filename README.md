# Mars-Weather

Here is an outline of the how to code the app:
1. Determine the requirements of the mobile app - what features it needs to have, what data it needs to display, what platform it should be developed for, etc.

2. Use the NASA API to retrieve the latest weather conditions on Mars. The NASA API provides real-time data on temperature, wind speed, pressure, and other weather-related information on Mars. You can use this data to create a weather forecast section in the app.

3. Use the NASA API to retrieve the latest images captured by the Mars rovers. The NASA API provides access to a vast library of high-resolution images captured by various Mars rovers. You can use this data to create a gallery section in the app that allows users to view and explore the Martian landscape.

4. Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections of the app. Use clear and concise language to explain the different features and data displayed in the app.

5. Implement the app using a programming language that is compatible with the target platform

First after creating the basic html and css files, go onto making the working of the app using javascript and make the changes accordingly
